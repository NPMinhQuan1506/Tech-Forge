### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1. Purpose
This document outlines the business requirements for the Tech-Forge Platform, a new gamified learning platform for computer science education. It defines the project's vision, business objectives, scope, and key success criteria. This BRD serves as a foundational agreement between stakeholders and the development team.

#### 1.2. Project Vision
To become a leading platform for self-directed computer science education by making learning interactive, engaging, and rewarding. We aim to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application through a gamified, progression-based ecosystem.

### 2. Business Problem & Opportunity

#### 2.1. Business Problem
Traditional online learning platforms often lack engagement, leading to high dropout rates. Learners struggle to stay motivated, find a clear learning path, and understand how different concepts connect. There is a need for a more structured, motivating, and hands-on learning experience.

#### 2.2. Business Opportunity
By introducing gamification elements (points, ranks, challenges, rewards), we can significantly increase user engagement and retention. Offering curated learning paths (Roadmaps) and premium, in-depth Courses creates clear value propositions for both free and paying users, opening up a sustainable revenue stream.
