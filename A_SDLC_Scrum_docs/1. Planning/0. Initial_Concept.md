## 1. Vision & Mission

**Vision:** To build a gamified, web-based learning platform, **Tech Forge**, that transforms the process of acquiring and sharing knowledge into an engaging, universe-themed adventure.

**Mission:** To provide a single platform where individuals can structure their personal learning, follow guided development paths, and share their created knowledge roadmaps with a vibrant community.

## 2. Core Concept: A Universe in Three Phases

The user experience is divided into three interconnected phases, each catering to a different level of engagement and learning goal. The entire ecosystem is tied together by a unified gamification system.

---

### **Phase 1: The Explorer's Archive (Tutorial Library)**

This is the free, foundational knowledge base for all users.

*   **Objective:** Exploration and casual learning.
*   **Content:**
    *   A vast library of computer science domains (e.g., `Programming Languages`, `System Design`, `Design Patterns`).
    *   Each domain contains topics (e.g., `C#`, `JavaScript`, `Python`).
    *   Topics are broken down into individual lessons, filterable by difficulty and tags.
    *   Includes sample exercises from a shared **Question Bank**.
*   **Gamification:**
    *   Users earn an **Exploration Score** for consuming content, which contributes to their profile's prestige.
    *   This score can be used to unlock cosmetic items (profile badges, flair).
*   **Progression:** No EXP or rank progression in this phase.

### **Phase 2: The Adventurer's Journey (Roadmaps)**

This phase provides structured, goal-oriented learning paths.

*   **Objective:** Guided skill development and progression.
*   **Content:**
    *   Pre-defined **Roadmaps** (e.g., "AI Engineer Roadmap").
    *   Each roadmap is a curated sequence of topics, lessons, and specific exercises.
    *   Content is unlocked sequentially as the user progresses.
    *   Features "Knowledge-Based Boss Battles" at the end of key stages.
    *   Includes access to exclusive "Challenge Instances" (specialized knowledge areas).
*   **Progression:**
    *   Users earn **Experience Points (EXP)** to level up and gain ranks.
    *   The system tracks progress and milestones.
*   **Economy:**
    *   **Forge Credits (FC):** The free, earnable currency. Acquired through roadmap activities and daily challenges. Used for basic shop items.
    *   **MusLunar Points (MP):** The premium currency. Acquired with real money. Used for premium items, cosmetics, and access to Phase 3.

### **Phase 3: The Master's Path (Courses)**

This is the premium tier for deep, expert-level learning.

*   **Objective:** Specialized, adaptive, and certified learning.
*   **Access:** Requires purchase using **MusLunar Points (MP)**.
*   **Content:**
    *   Exclusive, in-depth lessons and exercises not found elsewhere.
    *   **Adaptive Learning Path:** The curriculum adjusts dynamically based on the user's performance in initial assessments and periodic tests.
    *   Offered in tiered packages (e.g., higher tiers include more personalized support).
*   **Rewards:**
    *   Awards prestigious **Titles** and **Certifications** upon completion.
    *   Grants significant EXP and potential **MP** bonuses for high achievers.
    *   Unlocks access to exclusive **"Event Dungeons"** and story-driven side quests with rare rewards.

## 3. Key Supporting Features

### **User-Generated Content (UGC): "Open-Source Learning"**
*   **Create & Share:** Users can build their own roadmaps and share them with the community.
*   **Community Interaction:** Others can clone, star (favorite), and review community roadmaps.
*   **Leaderboards:** A ranking system will feature and reward top community creators.

### **Elite Challenges: The 7 Sages' Trials**
*   End-game, high-difficulty challenges themed around the seven core pillars of human intelligence.
*   These "Sanctuaries" offer unique puzzles and tests for the most advanced users.

### **MusLunar (Admin & Management System)**
*   A comprehensive backend system, codenamed **MusLunar**, for administrators to manage all platform activities, including users, content, courses, analytics, and reporting.

### **User Governance & Penalty System**
*   To maintain platform integrity, a system of rules and penalties will be in place.
*   Consequences for violations may include rank demotion, feature suspension, or a permanent, IP-based ban.

## 4. Target Audience

1.  **Students & Self-Learners:** Individuals looking for structured or exploratory ways to learn new skills in computer science.
2.  **Professionals & Mentors:** Experienced developers who want to document their knowledge, mentor juniors, or share their expertise with the community.
3.  **Team Leads & Managers:** Individuals who want to create custom learning roadmaps for their teams.

## 5. Next Steps

*   Flesh out this concept into a full Project Proposal.
*   Define the Minimal Viable Product (MVP) scope.
*   Conduct preliminary market and user research.
*   Develop high-level system architecture diagrams.
