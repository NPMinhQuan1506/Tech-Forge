# 🌌 Tech-Forge: The Open Universe of Computer Science Learning

Tech-Forge is a gamified learning platform for mastering computer science through structured tutorials, guided roadmaps, and dynamic courses — all wrapped in a universe of discovery, competition, and collaboration.

## 💡 Original Vision – The Founder's Story

> “I wanted a system that not only tracks what I learn but also lets me share my knowledge with others — my teammates, juniors, or friends.  
> What I envisioned is a gamified universe where learning, exploration, and contribution coexist.”  

The product is a **learning galaxy with 3 distinct phases**, each tailored to different user motivations:

### 🌐 Phase 1 – Tutorial Library (Free Exploration)

- Explore categorized subjects across the computer science universe: programming languages, system design, design patterns, and more.
- Each subject includes **topics** (e.g., C#, JavaScript, Python).
- Each topic contains structured **lessons**, grouped by tags, levels, or themes.
- Some lessons include sample exercises from the shared exercise bank.
- Users earn **Discovery Points**, which can be exchanged for badges, items, or bonuses in later phases.
- Tutorials are public — no account or login required.
- EXP and rank are *not* gained in this phase — it’s purely for exploration and learning.

### 🧭 Phase 2 – Roadmaps (Guided Progression)

- Learners can select a **Roadmap** (e.g., *AI Engineer*, *Fullstack Dev*) to follow a recommended learning path.
- Each Roadmap includes **selected topics and lessons** relevant to the goal — not full coverage.
- Special lessons and exercises are **unlockable** only through Roadmap participation.
- Users earn **EXP**, unlock new phases, and face unique challenges like **boss quizzes** or **hidden gates**.
- Learning progress is **tracked and visualized** by the system.
- Users collect **Free Points**, which can be used in the shop or converted into earnable perks.

### 🧠 Phase 3 – Courses (Premium Mastery)

- Courses are premium learning journeys, unlocked using **Earn Points**.
- Require pre-tests to evaluate level before joining.
- Courses contain **exclusive content and exercises**, not accessible in Tutorials or Roadmaps.
- Include **dynamic paths**, challenges, and mastery-based tests.
- Rewards: Titles, EXP, rare items, and entry into **story-based special events** (e.g., dungeons with AI bosses).
- Some learners will receive **Earn Points rewards** for performance.
- Courses are priced by **value tier**, and tracked by personalized progression.
